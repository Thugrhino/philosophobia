  1: `Growth in Self Domain

When we say someone that you will go far in your life or you will achieve greatness in your life in near future. Isn't that just something to think about.
That says, suppose you are in a room with 10 other fellows, and someone say enters the room that person is good at let's say economics, so he see some in that room who has a keen interest in economics, that person will say to that perticular fellow that you will achieve so much in your life and you will think that, I'm good at maths and he or she is not then why did that person say to that fellow he will achieve greatness and i will not, but the thing is he will achieve greatness in his or her life , you will achieve greatness in your life , the only matter of fact is that who will follow the thing which they are good at, it's just a simple thing nothing to be buzz about. But it's the thing that most of the fellows don't even understand in their 20's. By hearing someone say to others that you will achieve great things and for then they say you can't do anything in your life or achieve anything in your life, you feel rage and anger towards them and to words yourself, it just a thing that you can't achieve greatness by their expectations towards life but maybe you can achieve greatness in your life. Just a saying,"It doesn't matter how great orange you are, if someone wants apple then you are in no use for THEM".

  2: `Self Reflection 

(The Ocen reflects the whole world. But the only thing it failed to reveal is it's own depth)
(The love you see in others is your own reflection of love and i.e. same for hate also)
(Human beings are like mirrors.)

If we analyse these three statements then, Human beings are like ocean and mirror as they both reflect, our feelings or thoughts are like the depth of the ocean even a person can't estimate it's own feelings magnitude. So if we see our reflection in others and we can't see the other sinde of the mirror, i.e. if there are two people, they are ocean if they both reflect eachothers reflection and then we can't really and truly understand others until we understand ourselves and as in this world everyone is sleeping how can we see our own reflection if we can't see ourselves then how can we say that the reflection is mine?. And it's not bad on the positive side if both person treat eachother with mutual feelings and thoughts then maybe we can say both persons are reflection of each other as not meant by any behaviour difference or nature no one can change his nature we can supress it by with time it will always come back. 
So if you see someone hates you then it's you,who hate the person that makes you see that, that person hates you. Because even though we don't realise it but subconsciously we do so many things that we don't even understand, that being said the only way to make those three statements correct by being one in whole. Means everyone should be ONE, but that's not possible but maybe we don't know ourselves that much that we can clarify these things, how subconscious we all are connected to eachother that our subconscious self can see through that we can't, or maybe this theory is wrong!

“We can't see others if we don’t know ourselves, and if the world is asleep, who’s really awake enough to even reflect?” `,

  3: `Circus Of Universe

  Maybe this universe doesn't work as we think it should work, maybe the law doesn't apply to the absolute nothing. The beyond could not be explained. However if you think about it then we are alll connected but still lack in communicating with eachother because we are unable to communicate with the universe. We are so asleep that we couldn't see that we are sleeping, we are just lucid dreaming, that we think it's our reality. We can't think beyond the horizon.Because We couldn't explain how this universe or mistic law works, we try to explain it logically instead of finding the answer, we are all connected to a vast infinity source of energy that we don't need anything in life, everything exists within us. Think it as like you are the universe within yourself. We need ourselves. The more we want others the more we lose ourself, the more we need others the less we need ourselves. The answer lie within ourselves, but our conscious mind is stopping us from connecting with this universe. As we all could connect to this universe and become ONE.


Maybe this universe doesn’t work the way we think it should. Maybe the laws we worship collapse in the face of absolute nothing. Maybe the “beyond” isn’t meant to be explained — only felt.
We are all connected, yet somehow still alone. We fail to connect with each other because we’ve forgotten how to speak the language of the universe. We’re so deeply asleep, we dream that we’re awake.
This — what we call “life” — is just a lucid dream. We mistake the illusion for truth, and the horizon becomes a wall we can’t think beyond.
We don’t search for answers — we explain things logically to avoid searching. We are all connected to a vast, infinite source of energy. We already have everything we need — because we are the universe itself.
The more we crave others, the more we lose ourselves. The more we need others, the less we understand the one we already are. The answers lie within — but our conscious mind is the veil.
If we could silence it, we’d remember: We were never separate. We were always ONE.

  4: `About myself:
   
      I used to think for 5 years that i loved someone, but it was only obseeion, possessiveness, desire, or selfishness but surely not LOVE! 
     "If you really love some, then you should be selfless" but i was not, although i prayed for that person for 2 years but indirectly i was praying for myself and my happiness. It would be two things, i directly prayer God to make her mine, which is my selfish desire not her happiness. And second thing i prayed for ger happiness, safety and achievements, which will make her happy and in the end if she is happy in life wiill make me happy. 
     But if i truly have loved her then i should not have thought ill of her, no matter what. It was my selfish desire that, when i could achieve I said it wasn't good for me, which is absolutely wrong, when you love someone you should think about their peace of mind rather than yours. It took me 5 years to understand how much wrong I was i mistook it as love like every other individual. It was obsession nkt love. But i realised it because, the history is repeating itself and this time it feels different for someone, this time it didn't put hatered, it put peace, maybe some sadness but it was nothing as compared to the satisfaction that keeps my heart in harmony. Maybe the Star never been there for me and maybe never will as i want it to be. But things are beautiful as they are if i only force it to be as like i want it to be then it will only make me lose the flight with my dark side.

  5: `Diluated By Delusion

     People are so much influenced by the society, that it's sad that they don't even aware of that their mind is stil asleep, like said " Everyone in this world are sleeping, just few decided to wake up" means , dreams are beautiful, they think that dream as their bound destiny, but when they they decided to wake up they meet their real destiny and they destiny they dreamed of has already gone as it was inevitable, because dreams are not reality. We can and we have to make it out reality but like if we dream of a monkey as a man , we can't possibly make a money a man in reality, it's just not possible.
Just like that we are trapped in our own mind, and the society plays a vital role in it, we all aren't living our life, we are living upto someone's expectations. The sad thing is sometimes we wake up too late that it's too late to start or do some things. Life is very very simple but complected in mean time, it's just a matter of point of views. 
      The most mistook thing in this world is LOVE or maybe the most misused phrase TRUE LOVE, because believe it or not we are always being love without even asking it one way or another. And we are so twisted in our own mind and society's expectations that when the most unrequited love is generally offered, and you need it the most but you couldn't see it because the expectations have made you sooo blind that the potent ray of love couldn't reach you because the clouds of darkness has covered your perspective of every, and wneh you decide to look through those cloud, the sun might be set and the night sky covered the universe and you might think that it was always dark from the beginning and that's the main reason behind the trust issues of people. It's the most important thing to know your weakness and accept it don't fight it back by being dishonest with yourself accept it and embrace it then only you will able to see through the clouds and look how bright the sun shines. And trust the universe and believe in your and trust every individual.

  6: `HIGH ON LOVE (HIGH ON LIFE)

     Let's just take a senator to make it understand easily. It's evening time. You are sitting in a park bench with your other half. Under a street lamp. It's a park full of trees like a little forest. The highway is little far away from the place you both are sitting. The vehicles were passing by with blinking lights and some buzzing sound. It was little cold.  People are walking pass by the bench you both are sitting. 
      Not much intense BUT.... When you feel the time has stopped or rather it feels soo slow, you can't think straight, your mouth flickers, words  comes from your mouth feel like it's not what you are thinking. You can't see the people around you, they feel like they don't exist there, no one exists their only you both. You can't look at her. So you decide to look the vehicle far away and they feel like fireflies, the smell of forest feels like it clinging your body. You feel relaxed but tensed. It's the exact same feeling like when you are high on some drug or alcohol but the difference is you haven't took any and that's what feels high without even being High. Just one example of being high. 
     But for others things that's nothing to do with drugs or anything but could possibly kill you, BEING HIGH IN LIFE, just like said " Everything that kills me makes me feel alive" these are the things that makes you feel alive, but could kill you. For saying, it's a wonderful feeling, riding anything at high speed, doing reckless things, walking through fire. These things are something which not everyone would able to do it.

  7: `The Knight of Universe
  
         The world always protect those who protects it.
That's being said, if you have pure intention in this evil society, you might think you will end up hurting yourself and no one will protect you. But if you really think about it, if you couldn't fight for yourself then there will be alwas someone in your every phase of your life who will fight for you. That's the literal meaning of if you protect the world, the nature, the social then there will be always, someone who will protect you behalf for the world. There will be always, someone, maybe a friend, maybe a classmate, maybe a total stranger, or maybe a lover, there will be always someone. But if you don't care about it then you will end up hurting. Ever thought about it? Like it simply said, if you care for others, then others will care for you. And be the reason for someone to believe and have faith in this society. If you can't find SOMEONE then be the SOMEONE from others.
  `,

  8: `Language of Subconscious

  Love Don't have any language, it's a language itself. Then maybe or it's not maybe it the truth that i don't have love so I'm not being understood. Maybe what i think love is, isn't actually love, maybe it's different or an another thing than love that's why my language isn't being understood. Or maybe i don't deserve love or maybe is the concept that me and myself couldn't understand it.

  9: `Ultimate Foal In Life?
  
(FALSE STATEMENT AT ALLL)
The ultimate goal of a man!
If you ask in general to anyone what you want to be when you will grow up, they will say "A good human being!".
Some might say it because they actively trying to be a good human being and some others will say it because they think it's wise to say that. But if you really think about it, a man's ultimate goal should be becoming a good father to his children, then a good husband, then a good human being. I could have said a good son but it's not the ultimate goal na, it's your first step not the ultimate goal or final goal. Why a good father is first priority if you would ask? It's because making children is you and your partner's decision so if you bring a life in to this world then it's your responsibility to take care of it, then comes your wife, girls nature is to relay on someone and man's duty is to provide and protect those who relay on them, so if your wife gave her everything to trust you and be with you, it's your responsibility to look after her and it's both you and your wife's responsibility to look after your child or children. 
Then comes the target of becoming a good human being, because if becoming a good human being requires you to compromise and some cases sacrifice your own family then, maybe it's your decision but it's also your responsibility to protect your family( your wife and your child) first. So if everything allows you and the circumstances allows you to do good deeds then it's okay to becoming a good human being. But becoming a good human being comes with challenges and there are so many things to look after in order to do good. But still you should prioritize your family first. That's being said, first become a good father, then become a good husband and then a good human being. 

It might be controversial but being a good human should come first but if doing good can make you sacrifice your family without their will, then you failed as a good father and a good husband maybe you will become a good human being but again it contradicts you from a good human being.

So if you believe in selfless selfishness and your children do and your wife do then go all in be a great human being, give everything to this universe. Then again how can you give someone something that they gave it to you, universe gave us every then how can we give everything to universe? We will just be the one with universe again.

  10: `The Theory Of NOTHING 
  
So we are about to go on a journey, that might be controversial and i might get killed by Dumb sheeps driven by Delusion. 
But it's not their fault, not everyone can imagine, beyond their imagination. 

Subject: About God and Religion ☯️.

Theory of Expansion:
The universe is expanding, and it's expanding at the speed of 29,97,92,458 m / s. Almost 3,00,000 km/s.
And nothing can travel at the speed of light, why nothing, nothing refers to anyone which have mass. And in this universe everything have mass, the thing you refer as weight is actually mass, and mass never changes in an ideal condition, weight might varry from places to places. But mass is constant. 
So the elements from which the light is made of or they are light itself, they are called elections and they have mass of 9.1093837 / 10³¹ kgs naaa it's not 9 kgs see the 10 with power 31 , like divide 9 with 100000000000000......with 31 zeros. It's that much small , that kind of mass can trave at the speed of light.

And let's say you are in a room and you have a glove 🌍, if the globe represents the size of Earth then what will be the size and position of the moon?
The moon and earth comparison is,
Moon : Earth = 1 : 3.67
Like one earth can fit almost 4 moons so the size of the moon as compared to earth would be like a size of a tennis ball and the distance would be?!
It's not like 100 centimetres or 1 meters it would be like 9 meters like so much distance, like the moon will be in the next room or something. And what will be the distance of the sun?!  You think 100 meters away? 500 meters away? 1 kilometre away? It will be........ 35.2 kilometres away! And the size of the sun will be 10 story building size. So just imagine light travels at such a speed even if it's too small in mass it travels in a speed such a way it reaches the earth from the sun in just 8 minutes! 149.6 million kilometres in just 8 minutes 😃. 

The Elephant in the room , the main thing to understand! Let's say you are blessed with 2 meters height, and you reached that height at the age of 23, so you will expand at the rate of 6.5cm per year , and guess what the universe is expanding at the speed of light. 300000km in just a second.

Let's say universe is 6.5 cm and you also 6.5cm at the initial time and you both started to expand. Guess what you will be 2 meters in 23 years and you can't even easily calculate how much the universe have expanded by then like, i am here trying to explain how much vast the universe is like we can't even imagine even if we want to, and you will never able to image the universe completely here is why:
The speed of electrical signals in our brain, in our neurons is 432km/h. And at what speed the universe is expanding? 29,97,92,458 m / s. So it's impossible for any technology to simulate or our brain imagine the expanding this universe.

All I'm saying is to explain how vast this universe is and it's infinite, maybe we know the expansion rate but we don't know till what limit it will continue expanding. And something infinite comes with unlimited number or events and possibilities and we don't know about the universe it's like a quantum level of creature in a Atlantic ocean and it's srinking at the speed of light, here i refer srinking of the quantum level create instead of expanding of the Atlantic oceay, same thing. 
 
So when we are that much tiny, we don't know any idea how this universe works but it's works within without even us realising it, we dare to explain everything, even the creation of universe although we don't even know what's there in the other end of the Milky way Galaxy 😂. It's human physiology, which he doesn't understand, he fears it. Which he couldn't explain, he believes it, and believes in it with fate. 

The point I'm not saying the good doesn't exist or he haven't created us. All I'm saying a different perspective of God and it's creation.
The moto here is GOD=== ALIEN. (I did not used === for fun or just like out of the blue, it's the concept of JS which cross checks the data and data type).
The type of God with type of Alien.

Let's say Gods are alien and here is why!
Suppose you are a individual, let's say a middle class person from a devloped and advance country. You went for a vacation to a underdeveloped country, poor, uneducated, having zero ethics and remotely located and having ALMOST zero outer connection with outside world.
You went there with say the things you use in your day to day life and you carried some extra things you have fair skinn and all, you smell nice like you feel like a rich and vibrant aura. When you go there , they will see unusual, it's you, different from others, you standout there like a whole new individual, who doesn't look like them, speak like them or live like them, they will see a Total different thing, Thing in the sense they will not consider as a human, luje yku will be someone who is superior, intelligent and like have magical power (gadgets).
Like that Here is the main thing:
Go to the past , let's say stonage , you have nothing, you don't know anything about universe, anything about how weather works or how the solar system works and all , and then some creatures came from the sky, taugh you basics and told you or gave knowledge and wisdom for better life style, and at that time and senario and technology it's like absolutely impossible to make things understanding how it was working. Like how can they fly, change weather and destroy and create things, so here hey are, it's the concept of God. And religion, let's say humans have tendency to live in colony and they are teritorial , ao they don't like to associate ans interact with people who are different than others so from different part of the earth, there were people living different life according to their surroundings and environment and resources. And let's say Aliens just didn't came to one part of the world and let's say there were so many Types of Aliens, some are maybe some are good, some are bad, some are friendly, some are Sophisticated. And see every culture have their way of living and rituals and behaviour, it's because how they see and believe the idea of God. Some things in common like the rocket 🚀, it's similar to Temples and Rath , resembles spaceship. Ultimate weapon that could destroy the entire earth, nuclear weapons, source of energy, nuclear reactor, or cold fusion or even some energy sources we haven't discovered yet or hard to obtain by the current known technology. 
We say miracle, but nothing more than science. If you think science can't explain everything then , (some people are too uneducated to know what they don't know) it might feel impossible at this current technological generation to obtain something which seems magical but not impossible, we thought flying metals are imagination, reaching upto the heaven(sky) is impossible, making a metal float is impossible, trapping memories is impossible but nothing is impossible, things takes time to unreveal itself when you study it from the scratch. 

Making ourselves believing something which we don't even understand is foolishness, and then it doesn't make it wrong if you don't understand it. I'm not saying nothing is possible or god doesn't exist, I'm saying a different perspective about God, a way that explains it. The existence of God.

  11: `The Eyes of Dark
  It's the world where everyone just want to close their eyes, a world where there is a endless sand storm, you decided to open your eyes just to see the world but surely you will get blind eventually by the sand, but you are glad that atleast you are able to see the world up close. And in the end you will get blind, but there will be no difference, others are blind by not opening their eyes and you get blind but you have seen the world atleast.

yes, you’ll go blind—but your blindness will be earned, not inherited.
