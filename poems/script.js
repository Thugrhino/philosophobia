  1: `My Moon🌙

  She reflects gleam, not her glow.
But always alofe, like a lonely ghost.


She has scars, she has shadows,
but always serene, like the gentle snow.


The Ocean that sway, under her arms,
Never showed his abyss, to make her enchant.


Not perfect as they say she is, 
But still perfect as it is.
`,

  2: `High on Love
  
Beneath the lamp's soft, golden gleam,
In a forest where the shadows grow,
The world fades out, it’s just us two,
And all I see, my love, is you.

The hum of cars, a distant song,
The fireflies blink and move along,
Yet time stands still, my breath won’t flow,
A nervous calm I’ve come to know.

The forest scent wraps ‘round the air,
Your presence leaves me gasping there.
I try to speak, but words betray,
They stumble, lost, then drift away.

I look to lights that blur and gleam,
But you’re the heart of every dream.
A gentle high, no drink, no smoke,
Just love’s sweet spell—its tender cloak.

In this moment, the world is gone,
No one exists; we’re all alone.
You’ve stopped the clock, you’ve stilled my mind,
A love like this, so rare to find.

This quiet rush, this endless flight,
You’re my fire, my calm, my night.
Forever here, my soul will stay,
High on your love, come what may.

`,

  3: `Ghost in a flower 🏵️

  The sparkle in your eyes, so rare to find, 
Even the stars started to blush, by your golden smile.
As innocent it seems, as a night jasmine,
Makes me wonder, how can it not be seen.

The heart that holds so much to give,
Still couldn't see its own abyss.
A heart that witnessed a thousand storms,
Still deciding to beat, yet for others.

A hand that holds and never lets go,
Seen many bloods, but it was her own.
Never realized the warmth of her palm,
Giving others comfort, rather frost her own.

Always says sorry without making a fuss,
Yet the world decided to turn around on its own.
Always made her believe, she was the cause,
But in the world full of blinds, who can see is at fault.


`,

4:`Winter Haze

Just like flowers are hunted by the winter haze,
My heart is hunted by the memory of your gaze.

She bloomed in silence, soft and wild,
The world grew quieter when she smiled.
But seasons pass, and gardens close,
Even roses sleep beneath the snows.



Maybe love, that gentle thief,
Will learn to steal without the grief.

5:`In the symphony of US


In the sky full of stars, I think I saw you, ⭐
A light so rare, a love so true.
You are the night star of my sky, ✨
A gentle glow that will never die.

I just want to be part of your symphony, 🎼
The melody of your life, in perfect harmony.
You are the APRICITY of my soul, 🌞
Warming my heart, making me whole.

I got my eye on you, 👀
A love so pure, forever new.
I think I can push my luck with you, 🌟
A dream worth chasing, a bond so true.

You are like heaven when I’m in hell, 🌌
A story of love only time can tell.
You are all the colors in one... at full brightness, 🔅
A masterpiece painted with endless lightness.

I bring you three GERBERAS, 🌼🏵️🌸
To symbolize my love that’s eternally your.
You are my crutch when my legs stop moving, 🩼
My strength, my solace, my constant proving.


I want to be the someone of your life,
To share with you both joy and strife.
I love the version of myself you brought out, 🍀
With you, I found what life’s all about.

I love you more than yesterday, less than tomorrow, 🪽
A timeless love, both joy and sorrow.
Give me your forever, ♾️ I plead,
For you are the only heart I will ever need.

6:`Echoes of the Crimson Horizon


You are my evening sunset, a masterpiece of hues,
Painting my world with crimson reds and tranquil blues.
In the quiet sky where the auroras dance,
Your glow steals my heart with every glance.

You are the evening sky, vast and free,
A canvas of dreams and eternity.
A gentle breeze whispers your name,
Cooling my soul, igniting the flame.

You are the blue ocean, deep and wide,
A mystery I long to forever reside.
Your waves crash softly, soothing my pain,
And pull me to love you again and again.

You are a blue ice, calm yet fierce,
A touch so cold, yet a warmth it pierces.
Fragile and strong, your beauty shines,
A rare treasure in this heart of mine.

You are the crimson at dusk,
Burning with passion, enlighten my trust.
A fleeting moment, a perfect view,
A reminder that I belong to you.

Stay, my aurora, my evening light,
Through gentle breezes and starry nights.
For in your glow, I’ve found my place,
My life, my love, my heart's embrace.

7:`Season of Grief 

You were like a star to my midday eyes, 
You had so much to shine that i never realised.

I wasn't search for life as i was blind,
But when i decided to look up all i see is your eyes!

Although it was like a blink of an eye, 
But it let me see through even from my darkest side.

Alas i was not fortune as the storm passed before me, and the door for the life never opened for me.

But as like  a lotus,
I waited for my sun to rise!
`,

8:`STILLY NIGHT 




Sitting under the moon light,
Thinking of you.
This night feels lonely , 
But what can I do?

Never realised the meaning of life,
Until i met you.
Like the stars shows the path,
You showed me the light of hope, and made me go through  

I Always wondered "why you?",
Even though i never told you.
So many come and so many go,
But i want to stay besides you.

I always cherished the memories that i had with you, 
Never thought that i will be this close to you.
This feels warm, that i never felt before,
Always pray to God please let it stay, like this forever.

Beautiful like the shiney moon, no wonder how i fell in Love with you. 


Like the time of new moon , we always wait for the full moon, no matter how hard times are i will await for you, i will be always there for you, by your side facing those problems with you. I will walk along side no matter whatever it takes, thats a promise to myself.
